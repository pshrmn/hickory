# To DO

* Add a hash history class
* Add CI tests
* Add browser integration testing (and determine which browsers to actually support)
* Add support for basenames (and maybe change the name? baseSegment?)
* Add sessionStorage support so that we can preload existing locations when the user navigates
  back to the page.
